ANALYZING-THE-RELATIONSHIP-BETWEEN-DRUG-ABUSE-AND-VARIOUS-SOCIOECONOMIC-FACTORS4


The primary purpose of the project is to create awareness regarding the ill effects of drug/substance abuse by analyzing its effects on various socioeconomic factors like GDP per capita, deaths rates and its effects on gender and different age groups. By performing Exploratory data analysis on three related datasets, we concluded the following â€“
There is weak but still significant inverse relationship between the GDP per capita of US states and their deaths due to drug abuse.
When it comes to the effects on gender, we found that males comprise more than half of the drug related deaths and the death rates of males has only increased during the recent years while the increase in female deaths has remained stable.
Also, we found out that after alcohol, heroin was the major cause of admissions in the OASAS treatment program.
While heroin is the most common drug amongst all age groups in general, Marijuana is more popular amongst teenagers.
